                            <p>Like many of you I've been impressed with the music direction Gearbox/Telltale has taken. What has resonated with me (and many of you) was that they became a part of the story, offering insight to how the character's were feeling while also complimenting the mood of the environment (and let's not forget the cheesy but nonetheless epic intro to TFTB Episode 4!). Gearbox must like to groove, as it seems that the music of Borderlands is rooted in neo soul, indie rock, and country. So I compiled. –§–æ—Ä–º–∞ –ò–ù–í-15 (–∫–æ–¥ –û–ö–£–î ‚Äì 0317013) ‚Äì –∞–∫—Ç –∏–Ω–≤–µ–Ω—Ç–∞—Ä–∏–∑–∞—Ü–∏–∏ –Ω–∞–ª–∏—á–Ω—ã—Ö –¥–µ–Ω–µ–∂–Ω—ã—Ö —Å—Ä–µ–¥—Å—Ç–≤, –æ—Ç—Ä–∞–∂–∞—é—â–∏–π —Ä–µ–∑—É–ª—å—Ç–∞—Ç—ã –∏–Ω–≤–µ–Ω—Ç–∞—Ä–∏–∑–∞—Ü–∏–∏ –∫–∞—Å—Å—ã –æ—Ä–≥–∞–Ω–∏–∑–∞—Ü–∏–∏.

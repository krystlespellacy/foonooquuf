RUNNING WOLF3D & SPEAR/MODS ON VISTA/WINDOWS 7. DOS based games will only run on Vista by using DOSBox.It's free, and the file to download is 'DOSBox0.74Win32-Installer'. I recently picked up a Jaguar while i was road tripping across the US in a retro game store in Louisville, So far i have Cybermorph, Iron Soldier, I-War, and Checkered Flag. What would you suggest i pick up next? Was thinking Iron Soldier 2 (the cart version) since i'm already on the second to last mission for Iron Soldier, but i was also looking at maybe Raiden or Ultra Vortek. What do you think. Platform(s): PC Genre: First-Person World War shooter Estimated year of release: Late 1990s to early 2000 (I think) Graphics/art style: The graphics were VERY smiliar to CoD 1-3, Return to Castle Wolfenstein and earlier Medal of Honor games. So pretty much something like this ( or this (http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/wolfenstein/images/e/e8/Return_to_castle_wolfenstein_bemutato_gameplay_scre. So, I used to play this on my dads PC, at around the turn of the millennium. It was an FPS, you shot monsters in what felt like an office-block type building. There were about five weapons you could scroll through, one of them being a BFG. I distinctly remember orange walls, but I could be wrong - it was a long time ago. There were hidden areas that you could access by activating certain wall spots which were indistinguishable from the rest. There might have also been something about getting. 
So I played this game when I was really young. The UI and gameplay was similar to wolfenstein 3D (including the guy's face in the UI that will start looking worse if your health is low). There were guns in the game but I remembered that it was more fantasy themed so the enemies were skeletons, witches etc and some would use spells. Also, the first level (I think) was indoors but you could go out to this courtyard/garden area outside that had a lot of skeletons and hidden passages.

Hey r/vintagecomputing redditors, When I was in \~5th grade (1991), my Dad bought the family its first home PC. He ordered it through a work catalog (Albany International). It was the Gateway 2000 386 SX with DOS 3.3 and Windows 3.0 preinstalled. WordPerfect 5.1, Lotus 1-2-3, and a few other pieces of software like Wolfenstein 3D and PaintBrush and others. It had a 40 MB HDD and 4 MB of RAM. I cut my teeth on this machine and taught myself every basic concept I could glean from the MS-DOS Hope it fits the /r/patientgamer discussion, don't think /r/gaming will offer the type of replies I am looking for. So I've been playing games actively for the past 20 to 25 years. With hours increasing and decreasing depending on life at the time, I think I can average 3-4 hours daily, but mostly exclusive to PC (maybe 2% Gameboy and PS4). I've started out on the 12 inch floppies with black and green graphics on games i don't remember the title of, graduating to "classics" like Dune 2, Wolfen. I only really play my handhelds, so I've decided to divest myself of my console games. I am primarily interested in trading these for first person shooters for the Gameboy Advance, but I would also be interested in copies of Faceball 2000 (Gameboy), Retro Game Challenge (DS), as well as original and pocket/color link cables, faceplates for the (small) new 3ds, and other fun Gameboy range games/systems/items. ampnbsp; I have a lot of fun, if common, stuff for trade. I keep seeing these posts saying “Only OG gamers know what this is” or “Only OG gamers remember this” on a screenshot from a 2000s era FPS game with crosshairs and little or no pixelization. Do these kids realize there was 30 or 40 years of gaming before that? The real OGs would show polaroids of them in front of a PAC-Man, Galaga, or Donkey Kong arcade game. After that came those of us who played Pong, Atari and original NES. In the age of Sega, SNES and the advent of PC gaming General Info: \- 2GB VRAM (8GB and 16GB RAM), can be annoying for non gamers (waste). \- Same mainboard and bios as Ryzen 2XXX Series Aspire model \- Good cooling, not very loud. \- Decent 1080p display \- very fast in daily use. \- fast m2 drive. \- automatic frequency (TDP) balancing is pretty good. in some cases you can still get significant gains by setting cpu to 50% in order for the GPU to run at high clocks. \- Acer has great Bios support \- drivers from amd.com (https://amd. ###Hi! About 6 months ago, i added to /u/nintendeals the ability to track ua ser's wishlisted games and private message notifications when those games are on sale.

What will you be doing with this PC? Be as specific as possible, and include specific games or programs you will be using. I'm going to use this PC for gaming only; No edition nor streaming. I'll be playing League of legends, wolfenstein, CSGO, minecraft, and skyrim gt What is your maximum budget before rebates/shipping/taxes? 2000 USD, but if more for sure keep it less than 3000 gt When do you plan on building/buying the PC? Note: beyond a week or two from today means. so it didn't say if multiple TOMT were allowed but ima try anyway the first is a horror movie around 2000-2008 it was a cheesy movie where there were girls having a sleepover and the mom was making something in the kitchen. she hears something and pulls her shotgun on this guy in a hooded robe. then the guy throws a cross at the screen and it ended. the second horror movie ad was around the same time i believe, I think its angels and demons but I can't remember. there's a guy sitting </p>

                            <p>Думаю, я могу тебе помочь. Я разработал подключение от android к Microsoft SQL Server. Я использовал: веб-сервис с Linux Ubuntu, Apache в качестве веб-сервера, PHP и FreeTDS для подключения сервера Microsoft SQL, и он работает. SQLDroid. SQLDroid is a JDBC driver for Android's sqlite database (android.database.sqlite.SQLiteDatabase) originally conceived by Kristian Lein-Mathisen. I have an app on Google Play which logic is heavily based on sql database (Room). Now I am up to rewrite it for iOS as my first iOS project ever. I need your advice, guys, on mainly three things: 1) Which sql db solution to choose? I want to keep as much logic as possible, so I'm not looking into Realm or similar solutions. It must be also not to tricky to observe changes in database (rx wrapping or something of that kind) 2) Do I understand correctly that choosing VIPER is a good idea?. Мой код: public void addContact(String a, String b, String c, String d, SQLiteDatabase db) { //cursor is use to check if data is availble then show row is exist if not then execute insert query. Introduction Most of the Android applications use an API to send and receive data from server to client. API is very useful when applications need to send or receive data. In this tutorial I will show you how to create a Restful JSON based API for Android application using ASP.NET and Microsoft SQL Server database. Hi guys, I started learn Android some months ago creating an app. I had to look a lot on internet and SO but I was making progress, 2 months ago, sadly, I stucked on problem of keep data of my app. At the beginning I tried to create a file for but it didn't worked, I tried to learn room (the new way to use sqllite) but i failed, I tried a little sqllite but I failed again. So, the question is, I just have to try again in one of this subject? If so, someone have some good resources? · В этом видеоуроке показано как создать андроид приложение, связанное с БД MySQL. Часть 2. Создания Android. 
Of course. Connecting to SQL Server is a function of writing an application which queries the data and returns a resultset. How that is exposed to the world is up to you. I’ve written any number of apps which permit browser-access to reports which. Hey there i'm free to do some work with one of this technologies php , android , java , Sql with some expiernce Продвинутый курс по разработке android-приложения QuizApp Цена снижена! В этом Продвинутом курсе вы узнаете. In this article, I have attempted to demonstrate the use of SQLite database in Android in the simplest manner possible. Most of the articles and demos which I have seen on the net were not very simple for a layman to understand. Also most of the examples assume a deep knowledge of Android 
I'm learning SQL and would like to be able to run queries against test DBs (eg Oracle's HR schema) from my Android phone. Mostly this will be just to follow the examples/exercises in the textbook I am using, nothing with more than a few hundred rows of data. Preferably the DB would be on the phone itself, but I could also set it up on my computer (but would need to secure the connection and get a dyn-dns client going - likely more work than needed) I've seen a few apps that might work (such. javascript php java c# android html c++ css jquery python больше меток Интересные 6 Конкурсные Популярные За неделю За месяц. In this tutorial, we are going to learn about Android SQLite database CRUD example. Android SQLite is open source relational database which can be used for performing crud operations. I'm planning to create an app which will have account system. Login, friendship relations and all that. The problem is that I've never really used an SQL database before. So I'm not sure how exactly to approach this. Are there any great guides out there that show the best way to connect an Android app to an SQL database and then how to operate SQLite. Платформа Android имеет встроенный инструментарий для управления базой данных sqlite3. Android default Database engine is Lite. SQLite is a lightweight transactional database engine that occupies a small amount of disk storage and memory, so it's a perfect choice for creating databases on many mobile operating systems such as Android, iOS. By default, SQLite on Android I think that we should share our top 3 plugins that ease every day development. Mine are: 1. Rainbow brackets 2. Json to Kotlin pojo 3. Deep clean What are yours.

I'm learning Java and having a lot of fun with it, I used to be super up to date with html and css when I was in highschool, but I can't imagine doing just front end for a career. I like the idea of creating logic for the structure of a program, but not just pure front end or pure logic. Because I'm still new to software I'm a bit worried I won't be good at it or like it since I can't 'see' myself in a specific company or position. Any ideas or thoughts? Thanks. \ I know people ask for project ideas all the time, but I rarely see suggestions where PHP and SQL are appropriate, and I'd like to use those two langauges for at least one project. Thinking of a blogging As title says, I've opened an issue (https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/123071304) on the Android tracker that requests more elements of Architecture Components libraries be Android free. For example `LiveData` could easily be packaged as `jar` to be used in your domain (e.g. to directly pass Room's observable queries). Similarly `ViewModel` could be used in pure Java/Kotlin modules for a separate, clean presentation layer. Overall feels to me like having so much of these components.  TL;DR: have an AS in CS, took a break to save for college, got stuck in a loop, finished Udacity's programming intro course and now have no idea how to go from here to learning enough for a real job. I took several CS classes in high school, then obtained an AS in CS from community college- through both, the language taught to me was Java. I stopped to work and save money for college, since I more or less support myself as my parents don't have money, and got stuck in a loop. So, recently iOS, Android technologies.

I'm trying to build an app that I thought was quite simple but turns out the DB design is giving me some trouble. It's probably not that complex but I'm very new to Xamarin and software development in general and this has turned out to be another important knowledge gap. Can anyone recommend any books, tutorials, blogs or anything else that covers the basics of database design? EDIT: For clarity I’m talking about DB design for the back end API. Not strictly Xamarin but I thought it was relevan. First off I apologize greatly if I am posting in the wrong spot! I am currently a student getting my Bachelor's in Computer Science majoring in Game Dev in Montreal. I have already received a DEC (Quebec Cegep) for Computer Science with 2 years of Co-op in Software Development and graduated with great distinction. The reason I moved to Montreal was to use the University's Co-op Program to enhance my skills, and as a way of breaking into any of the amazing studios situated here.

What advice would you give to someone with 2-3 years OOP experience looking for part-time work while attending a university? My preferred language is java but I also have some experience with android, sql, and net development. Hey r/Kotlin, I´m currently learning how to code in Kotlin for Android, so I hope, this question is not out of place here. In my exercise project, I´m going to store some User Data in a Database. Therefore, I´m looking for a free (SQL) Database host and I´m wondering, if you guys have any suggestions, which one to choose? What are the main criticisms after which one should choose a host (beside storage space)? And for future projects: Do you have any suggestions for a paid host? I am grate. I've been a self taught coder since I was 6, starting off with C64 BASIC and have worked my way up through Windows and web technologies (VB6, VBscript, ASP, ASP.Net, CGI-BIN DOS(??!!), some PHP, some Android, SQL), last year getting my teeth in to JavaScript and PowerShell. This has all been as a hobby, so liberal sprinkles of bad practice and programmerhorror abound. My job role has taken on a large chunk of coding now that I've been recognized for my analytical skills, and have developed. If anyone wants to test out the initial beta of my etn capable point of sale, the very first somewhat stable build 'should' be installable. 14 day trial 🤣 There's a windows install, to setup the sql database, and an android install Any issues or comments to crowsoftapps@gmail.com I'll be updating the files occasionally as I fix or improve stuff. So far it installs fine on windows 10, 64 bit, android 8 (Samsung S9) If you'd rather not trust me, i recommend you use a phone and pc without. </p>
